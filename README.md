# SmartGate

SmartGate is an Arduino-based automatic gate opener system designed to provide convenience and security for gate access. Utilizing a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor, SmartGate detects motion in its vicinity, triggering the gate to open automatically, allowing seamless entry or exit without the need for manual intervention.

This project aims to simplify gate access for various applications, including residential driveways, parking lots, and industrial facilities.
